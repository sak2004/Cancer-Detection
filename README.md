Logistic Regression Model for Prediction
Project Overview
This project involves building a logistic regression model to predict outcomes based on various independent variables. The model is trained on a dataset, and the accuracy of the predictions is evaluated using the test set. Additionally, a confusion matrix is calculated to assess the model's performance.

Installation
To run this project locally, you will need to install the required Python libraries.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt should contain:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib (optional for visualizing confusion matrix)
Dataset
The dataset contains various independent variables (features) that are used to predict a binary outcome (target). Ensure that your dataset is cleaned and pre-processed before training the model.

Example Dataset Format:
Feature1	Feature2	Feature3	Target
3.5	1.2	4.8	0
2.3	3.7	1.6	1
...	...	...	...
Feature Selection
Various features are selected as input to the logistic regression model. You may perform feature engineering and scaling if necessary.

Modeling
Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is used to classify the binary target variable using a set of independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the log-odds of the outcome and the independent variables.

Train/Test Split
The dataset is split into training and test sets. Typically, 70-80% of the data is used for training, and 20-30% for testing.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Performance Evaluation
Accuracy
After training, the model is used to predict outcomes on the test set. Accuracy is calculated to assess how well the model performs.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix is generated to visualize how many correct and incorrect predictions the model made.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(conf_matrix)
You can also plot the confusion matrix:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.ylabel('Actual Label')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.show()
How to Run

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use logistic regression for binary classification tasks, with accuracy and confusion matrix metrics providing insight into the model's performance. While logistic regression is simple and interpretable, its performance may depend on the features and dataset quality.
